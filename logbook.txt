question 1 :
What is the data structure for node and list?


question 2 :
Does each input nc command cause the program to create one thread?
And the dealy used is trying to stimulate the scenario ready to wirte or not ready?
In this case, several threads may write to the same list at same time, therefore we need a locks (mutex)?


question 3 :
What does it mean by "for each incoming read or line you will create a new node and added to the shared list."
Including the command?
